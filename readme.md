# U.S. States Game

This is a simple game to test your knowledge of U.S. states. The game uses Python's turtle module to provide a graphical interface.

## How to Play

When you run the game, you will see a map of the United States. Your task is to enter the names of the U.S. states. If your guess is correct, the state's name will appear on the map.

The game continues until you have guessed all 50 states or you type 'Exit'.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- pandas
- turtle

## Setup

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required Python packages. You can do this by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Running the Game

## Data

The game uses data from the 50_states.csv file to check your guesses and to display the state names on the map. When you finish the game, it creates a states_to_learn.csv file with the names of the states you didn't guess.
